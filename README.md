## Our Functionality
- Users can register as free agents, or partial/complete groups
- Free agents can request, or be requested, to join partial groups
- Users can list skills, interests, contact methods, etc

## Our Value
- Streamlines the process of group-forming, especially for distance education
    - No more checking to see if someone you know is in a group or not
    - No more emailing and waiting to see if a group has space for you or not
- Allows for the formation of groups with better-aligned skills and interests
    - Partial groups can find free agents with skills the group needs
    - Free agents can find groups whose skills they can work well with
